- Stable release.
- **[Breaking Change]**: Searching in multiple file cabinets have been changed.
  The search no longer supports `additionalFileCabinets()`.  Please use
  `fileCabinets()` instead. Example:

```php
$paginator = DocuWare::search()
    ->fileCabinet('id-first')
    ->additionalFileCabinets(['id-second'])
    ->get();
```

Changed to:

```php
$paginator = DocuWare::search()
    ->fileCabinets(['id-first', 'id-second'])
    ->get();
```
